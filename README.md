# üë©‚Äçüíª Laura Shehadi

Hi! I‚Äôm Laura ‚Äî a Cognitive Science student at the University of Toronto, focusing on Computational Cognition with a minor in Data Science. I‚Äôm interested in how programming, AI, and data come together to help us understand how people think and interact with technology.

This GitHub is a portfolio of my computer science projects, including creative tools, logic-based solvers, and data-driven work. **I‚Äôm continuously updating this page as I build new things ‚Äî stay tuned üëÄ**
