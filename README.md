# 👩‍💻 Laura Shehadi

Hi! I’m Laura, a Cognitive Science student at the University of Toronto, focusing on Computational Cognition with a minor in Data Science. I’m interested in how programming, AI, and data come together to help us understand how people think and interact with technology.

This GitHub is a portfolio of my computer science projects, including creative tools, logic-based solvers, and data-driven work. 

**I’m continuously updating this page as I build new things — stay tuned 👀**

## 🧩 Projects

- **Raccoon Raiders**  
  A 2D object-oriented Python game featuring custom class hierarchies, modular architecture, and interactive gameplay mechanics.

- **Pixel Art Drawing Tool**  
  A grid-based drawing application with customizable canvas size and pixel interaction. Developed with a focus on intuitive UI design, smooth rendering, and efficient state tracking.

- **Automated Puzzle Solver**  
  A Python program that solves logic-based puzzles using breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms. Emphasizes recursion, graph traversal, and object-oriented structure.
<!-- 
- **Toronto Bike Share Analysis**  
  A data-driven project involving parsing, querying, and mutating large-scale datasets. Implemented algorithmic functions to support real-time analysis and user-defined filters.
